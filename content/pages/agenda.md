To facilitate preparation for the event, below are a list of ideas for potential hacks.  Links to documentation and useful publications will be made available as the event approaches.  Check back often for updates.

* Compute eta-Earth for G, K, and M stars
* Compare occurrence rates based on different methodologies
* Compare occurrence rates derived from different catalogs
* Generate mock planet populations to serve as ground truth
* Examine detection contours for different stellar populations
* Quantify improvements with higher fidelity products
* Explore the false alarm population and possible mitigations
* Assess the need for star-by-star detection efficiency measurements
* Execute sensitivity analyses for various input assumptions
