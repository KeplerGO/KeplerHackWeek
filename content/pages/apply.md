Potential attendees will need to complete and submit a [application form]() which includes a 1-2 paragraph statement describing your expected contribution and/or expertise relevant to the objectives of the event. Applicants will receive a response within 1-2 weeks of submission. Participation will be on a first-come, first-served basis limited to 25-30 people who demonstrate ([on the application form]()) the ability to make a relevant contribution to the work.

The formal deadline for applications to attend is September 4, 2015. However, we may be forced to close registration early if the participant list fills up. Apply early to increase your chances of being accepted!
