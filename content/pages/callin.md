The workshop will be streamed live via Adobe Connect. To connect to the meeting, please point your browser toward [http://connect.arc.nasa.gov/k2-microlensing/](http://connect.arc.nasa.gov/k2-microlensing/). You will need to be approved to view the stream. We won't start approving people until 8.30am on Thursday May 7.

If you have never attended an Adobe Connect meeting before you can [test your connection](http://connect.arc.nasa.gov/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm) and read a [quick overview](http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html).

We will not be using the Adobe Connect audio line for external participants to speak to those attending in-person. For external participants to be heard in the meeting room they will need to call-in via telephone. If you need to be heard in the room then please email [Tom Barclay](mailto:thomas.barclay@nasa.gov) to ask for the telephone line number and passcode.
